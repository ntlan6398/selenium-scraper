For scraping the Shopify Apps Store, I used Selenium to navigate the website and extract the data. The data is then saved to an Excel file using the Pandas library.
I just scraped the main categories with category name and url from the Shopify Apps Store homepage.
You can see the code in the scrape.py file.
For the whole Shopify Apps scraping project, which I using Puppeteer, you can see the code this link: https://github.com/ntlan6398/Shopify_App_Scraper.
